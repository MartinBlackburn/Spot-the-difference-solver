#Spot the difference solver

A browser based spot the difference solver.

##How it works
The camera takes two images (marked out by the black box). It then compares the left image to the right image, pixel by pixel. 

Then by assuming the RGB colours (of the left and right image) are a point in 3D space you can then get the disatance between 
them and if it is over a certian amount a green overlay is added to that pixel.
